# Archaeological ABM at Cologne: from concept to application
Materials for the session organised by the [CoDArchLab](http://archaeoinformatik.uni-koeln.de/) in the Institute of Archaeology at University of Cologne (20/6/2022).

This exercise introduces some Agent-based modelling (ABM) techniques used in archaeology. More specifically, it covers the prototyping of a conceptual model into a working simulation model, the 'refactoring' of code (cleaning, restructuring, optimising), the re-use of published model parts and algorithms, the exploration of alternative designs, and the use of geographic and archaeological data to apply the model to the context of a specific case study.

This tutorial uses [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), a flexible well-established modelling platform that is known for its relative low-level entry requirements in terms of programming experience. It has been particularly used in social sciences and ecology, both for research and pedagogic purposes.

## Preparation

To start the tutorial, you only need to:

- Install the latest version of NetLogo by downloading the system-specific installation files here: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml 
- Download the contents of this repository into a local folder.
